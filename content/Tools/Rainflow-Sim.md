## What it does

Small MIT-licensed Grasshopper Python script that drops water particles on a mesh and traces their downhill paths, then clusters the flow lines to show where runoff converges. It is a qualitative early-design aid; the authors state it does not model real fluid dynamics, volumes or material properties.

## What it can calculate

- Rain-particle flow paths over terrain/roof meshes (gravity + momentum)
- Flow-line clustering / convergence (accumulation) zones
- Indicative drainage and ponding/flood-risk locations

## Status

Small project: 5 commits, last activity about Oct 2024, no releases, 15 stars (checked 2026-10). Treat as an unmaintained proof of concept.
