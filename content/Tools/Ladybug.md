## What it does

Free Grasshopper plugin (and Python library) for importing and visualising EnergyPlus weather data and running fast geometric climate analyses. It produces sun paths, wind roses, psychrometric charts, outdoor comfort indices and solar radiation / sun-hour maps on design geometry, and is the base layer of the Ladybug Tools suite.

## What it can calculate

- Weather-file (EPW) visualisation and statistics
- Sun path and sun position
- Incident/annual solar radiation on geometry (kWh/m²)
- Direct sun hours / sunlight hours
- Radiation rose and radiation dome
- Wind rose and wind profile
- Psychrometric chart
- Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI)
- Predicted Mean Vote (PMV)
- Adaptive comfort
- Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET)
- Heating/cooling degree days
- View percent / sky view / sky mask
- Shade benefit and thermal shade benefit

## Status
