## What it does

Ladybug Tools plugin for urban and district energy modelling built from 2D footprints/floor plates. It is the main Rhino/Grasshopper front end for NREL's URBANopt SDK, adding OpenDSS grid analysis, REopt PV/battery optimisation and urban heat island correction of weather files.

## What it can calculate

- District-scale annual energy use (via URBANopt/OpenStudio/EnergyPlus)
- Peak loads and demand response across districts
- Electrical grid / transformer and feeder loading (OpenDSS)
- Cost-optimal PV and battery sizing (REopt)
- Urban heat island-adjusted weather files (Urban Weather Generator, UWG)
- Operational carbon emissions (US grid carbon intensity)

## Status

Active; distributed in Ladybug Tools 1.x (2026). AGPL-3.0.
