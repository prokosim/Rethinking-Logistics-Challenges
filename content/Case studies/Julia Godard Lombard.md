## Project

The project asks how storage data-centre capacity can grow in Prague without new construction, starting from the large stock of unused buildings (about 5.68 million m² in Prague). After mapping data-centre typologies and matching them against a matrix of listed abandoned buildings by size, the neglected 1847 Desfourský Palace near Masarykovo station was chosen. The building is prepared in a phase P0 (selective demolition, recycled-steel column-beam grid, building-wide HVAC, dry coolers in the roof) and then tested in three phases with an increasing data-centre share (20%, 50%, 80%). Heat from servers in temperature-controlled steel boxes is recovered for heat-hungry programmes chosen for their heat demand and social value, and in later phases for neighbouring buildings and the district.

## How the student framed the challenge

- Heat waste from data centres
- Adaptive reuse of abandoned listed buildings
- Urban integration of digital infrastructure
- Data centre energy and cooling demand

## Metrics and evidence

## Tools

- [[Geoportal Praha]] — Utility network base map (electricity, communication, gas, sewage) around the site
- prazdnedomy.cz database — Inventory and floor areas of listed abandoned buildings for the typology/size matrix
- [[Ladybug]] *(probable — inferred from the graphics, not named)* — Wind rose / sun-path overlay on the site plan

## Trade-offs

- Raising the data-centre share increases heat production, recoverable heat and heat-recovery radius, but lowers the jobs created (social impact) as sauna and dry-food production are removed by P3.
- More servers raise recoverable heat but also raise energy consumption and water consumption, which grow with the data-centre share.
- Maximising solar panels improves energy supply but adds structural load and lowers biodiversity net gain (questionnaire).

## Decision

The heat balance showed that even the small P1 data centre produces far more recoverable heat than the café, sauna and dry-food programmes need, which supported choosing heat-hungry programmes and planning to export surplus heat to neighbours and the district in later phases. The phased approach (P1 to P3) and a building-wide HVAC installed in P0 were chosen so the data-centre share can grow without new structural work.

## Open questions

- Not sure how to calculate how much renewable energy can be produced on site (questionnaire 1.3).
- CapEx/OpEx ratio, surface-runoff reduction, BNG approach and native species not yet known (questionnaire).
- Carbon, land use, transport, biodiversity and health KPIs appear only as unlabelled relative bars without numbers.
- Biggest gap named: KPI understanding and the evidence base (6.2).
