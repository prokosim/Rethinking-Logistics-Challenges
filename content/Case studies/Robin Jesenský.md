## Project

The project addresses data centres' high water and electricity use for cooling and their poor use of space. It proposes HALECS, a row of six modular server halls (each 18.3 × 3.6 m, 6.1 m tall with fan and vents) whose curved copper shells, sloped 'cooling fins' and open intake vents channel prevailing ground wind through the servers, combined with an enclosed water-cooling loop per server that runs from floor to fins and could supply heat for residential water heating. Site selection was driven by wind speed, leading to a windy coastal location near Grindavík, Iceland, analysed with a Ladybug wind rose. The 200-server design occupies about 425 m², compared with an existing ~1,024 m² hosting data centre with about 184 racks, and material quantities and GWP figures are estimated for the copper shell and steel ribs.

## How the student framed the challenge

- Water and energy use for data-centre cooling
- Space efficiency of data centres
- Wind-driven passive cooling of buildings

## Metrics and evidence

Every metric the project used, as named by the student, with the value, the calculation and the portfolio page.

| Metric | Student's wording | Value | How it was calculated | Tool | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[Water consumption]] | Water Management – Liters / Time | Shown only as an unlabelled comparison bar; no numbers | Water used for cooling over a time period, compared to data centres of similar capacity. | not stated | 30 |
| [[Power usage effectiveness]] | Energy Efficiency – Processing / Watts | Shown only as an unlabelled comparison bar; no numbers | Average processing delivered per watt used; electricity saved versus other common cooling strategies of similar capacity. | not stated | 30 |
| [[Land take]] | Use of Space – % of area utilized | 192 m² server space of 422.73 m² total (≈45%); typical hosting data centres use 1/3–1/4 of building as server space (about 1/2 incl. hallways) | Area free of structure (or share of area used as server space) compared to average facilities of similar capacity. | manual / formula | 20, 30 |
| [[Land take]] | Data Center Comparison | Existing COOLHOUSING data centre ~1,024 m² for ~184 racks vs proposal ~425 m² for 200 servers (less than half the area) | Building area compared for similar server capacity against an existing hosting data centre (rack count estimated from typical spatial distribution). | manual / formula | 21, 22 |
| — | Self-sufficiency – Human Time Spent | Shown only as an unlabelled comparison bar; no numbers | Human time spent in or around the structure compared to structures of similar capacity. | not stated | 30 |
| [[Embodied carbon intensity]] | Copper GWP | 5 mm: 3,300 kg, GWP 9,500; 10 mm: 6,600 kg, GWP 19,000 (unit given as kg CO2 eq/m³) | Copper mass for the shell at 5 mm and 10 mm thickness multiplied by a GWP factor; figures rounded up. | not stated | 23 |
| [[Embodied carbon intensity]] | Structural Steel GWP | 414 m³; 541,650 kg if solid; GWP 373,000 (unit given as kg CO2 eq/m³, if solid) | Steel volume per rib (6.9 m³) × 10 ribs per module × 6 modules = 414 m³, converted to mass if solid and multiplied by a GWP factor. | not stated | 24 |
| [[Wind conditions]] | Location – wind speed map | ≈9.82 m/s marked on legend at 100 m height for the Grindavík area | Mean wind speed at the candidate site read from a wind resource map at 100 m height, used as the key site-selection criterion for passive cooling. | not stated (wind atlas map – visual inference) | 28 |
| [[Wind conditions]] | Ladybug LD Wind Rose | Speeds 0.5–27.3 m/s; calm 1.75% of time (153 h); dominant N/NNE and SSE directions | Annual hourly wind rose from TMYx weather file (Keflavík Intl. Airport) showing speed by direction and calm hours. | Ladybug (Grasshopper) | 29, 30 |
| — | Data Center Structure – battery packs | 4 packs, 13.6 m² each, 20–40 cm height | Plan area of four ceiling battery packs (400 × 340 cm) between roof fan and servers. | manual / formula | 25 |

## Tools

- [[Ladybug]] — Wind rose of Keflavík TMYx weather file and a Grasshopper script measuring wind-rose polyline lengths
- Rhino — Wireframe section model V11 (visual inference from viewport style)
- SketchUp — Early model V1 sections and module plan (visual inference from viewport style; not named)
- Wind atlas web map — Site wind speed at 100 m height for site selection (visual inference; source not named)

## Trade-offs

- Reducing cooling water use and cooling operating cost brings no biodiversity or ecological benefit to the site (questionnaire).
- A thicker copper shell (10 mm vs 5 mm) doubles copper mass and its embodied GWP, a choice the student lists without resolving.
- Wind speed drives site choice, but the windiest candidate sites were protected or hard to reach for heavy construction vehicles (questionnaire, location alternatives).

## Decision

Wind data (wind atlas and Ladybug wind rose) supported siting the data centre on a windy, non-protected coastal location near Grindavík and orienting the modular shells to capture ground wind for passive air cooling; space comparison with an existing hosting data centre supported a compact 425 m² modular layout for 200 servers.

## Open questions

- Cooling water, energy efficiency and self-sufficiency KPIs have no values; bars are illustrative only.
- No airflow/CFD simulation of the passive cooling; student names wind physics and advanced engineering as the missing knowledge (questionnaire 1.3).
- Economy, LCA, water runoff, biodiversity and location questions answered 'I don't know yet' (questionnaire).
- Student reports needing to study the KPI evidence base and struggling with presentation (questionnaire 6.2).
- Location may change again because of access for heavy machinery (questionnaire).
